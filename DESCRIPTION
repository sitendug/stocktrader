Description: This package is my feeble effort to cobble together the impressive work of quant stalwarts who created packages like TTR, BatchGetSymbols and Prophet. 
              This package can be used to pick a stock of their choice and understand some fundamental and technical characteristics without deeply delving into the programming aspect of things. 
             This package has been created to shave off time from my analysis workflow and I hope that it will help others like me. This package is still in its early stages and comes with two simple functions. 
             I hope to add additional functionality to the same as we move forward.
